== Tutorial Sources
Before we start setting up the environment, let's clone the tutorial sources and set the `TUTORIAL_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the tutorial:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
git clone -b {branch} https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/knative-tutorial
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/knative-tutorial"
----

ifndef::workshop[]
[IMPORTANT,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

This tutorial was developed and tested with:

- Knative `{knative-version}`
- Minikube `{minikube-version}`
- OpenShift `{openshift-version}`
====
endif::[]

[#tools]
== Tutorial Tools

The following CLI tools are required for running the exercises in this tutorial. Please have them installed and configured before you get started with any of the tutorial chapters.

TIP: You can also use https://podman-desktop.io/[Podman] instead of Docker. The advantage of Podman is that it is 100% Free Open Source and does not need to run with elevated privileges. Just use 'podman' instead of 'docker' throughout the tutorial's instructions, or `alias docker=podman`.
